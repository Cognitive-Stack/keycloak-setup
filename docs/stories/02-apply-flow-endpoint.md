### Completion Notes
- Created the router, controller, and service layers for the `flow` feature.
- Implemented the `POST /api/v1/realms/:realmName/flows` endpoint with placeholder service logic.
- Added a mocked integration test for the new endpoint, which passes.
- All acceptance criteria have been met.tecture pattern defined in `docs/architecture.md`.
*   **Touch points:** `src/routes/`, `src/controllers/`, `src/services/`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new file `src/routes/flow.js` is created that defines the `POST /api/v1/realms/{realmName}/flows` route.
2.  A new file `src/routes/index.js` is created to act as the main API router, and it uses the new flow router.
3.  The main `app.js` is updated to use the main API router with a `/api/v1` prefix.
4.  A new controller `src/controllers/flow.js` is created with a handler function for the route.
5.  A new service `src/services/flow.js` is created with a `createFlow` method.
6.  A new service `src/services/keycloak.js` is created to handle communication with the Keycloak API.
7.  For this story, the services can contain placeholder logic, but they must be wired together correctly.
8.  The endpoint returns a `201 Created` status with a success message on a placeholder successful response.
9.  The `GET /healthz` endpoint continues to work unchanged.

**Technical Notes:**
*   **Integration Approach:** This story builds upon the foundational server structure by adding the first feature endpoint. It will implement the routing, controller, and service layers as defined in the architecture.
*   **Key Constraints:** The implementation must strictly follow the component architecture and API design outlined in `docs/architecture.md`.

**Status:** Completed
