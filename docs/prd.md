# Keycloak Auto-Configuration Enhancement Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
*   Increase Development Velocity by automating Keycloak authentication flow configuration.
*   Improve Security & Standardization by enforcing consistent, vetted authentication patterns.
*   Enable developers to set up Keycloak realms with complex authentication flows in minutes, without manual UI intervention.

### Background Context
The existing Keycloak auto-configuration tool successfully manages identity provider setup but lacks the capability to configure authentication flows. This gap creates a significant bottleneck for developers and DevOps engineers, who currently rely on manual, error-prone, and non-versionable processes to set up complex authentication logic in Keycloak. This project aims to close that gap by extending the tool to generate and apply complete, use-case-driven authentication flows as code, starting with a "first broker login" flow that includes profile completion, domain-based access control, and automatic account linking. This will streamline environment setup and ensure consistency across projects.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
*   **FR1:** The tool SHALL generate a complete JSON configuration for the "first broker login" authentication flow, adhering to Keycloak's API specifications.
*   **FR2:** The generated "first broker login" flow SHALL include a mandatory step to ensure user profile completeness (specifically, `firstName` and `lastName`). If these are missing, the user SHALL be redirected to a profile update form.
*   **FR3:** The generated "first broker login" flow SHALL include a step for email domain-based access control. This step SHALL allow an administrator to configure a comma-separated list of approved domains. If a user's email domain is not on this list, their login SHALL be denied with an appropriate message.
*   **FR4:** The generated "first broker login" flow SHALL include a step for automatic account linking. If a user logs in via an external identity provider and an account with the same email already exists, the tool SHALL automatically link the new provider to the existing account and display a confirmation message. If no account exists, a new one SHALL be created.
*   **FR5:** The tool SHALL be capable of applying the generated Keycloak authentication flow configuration to a specified Keycloak realm via the Keycloak Admin API.
*   **FR6:** The tool SHALL provide clear and actionable feedback to the user regarding the success or failure of applying the configuration, including any errors returned by the Keycloak API.

### Non Functional Requirements
*   **NFR1:** **Performance:** The tool SHALL be capable of applying a generated authentication flow configuration to a Keycloak realm within 30 seconds.
*   **NFR2:** **Security:** The tool SHALL handle all sensitive credentials (e.g., Keycloak admin credentials, identity provider client secrets) securely, utilizing environment variables or other secure mechanisms, and SHALL NOT hardcode them within the codebase or configuration files.
*   **NFR3:** **Usability:** The tool SHALL provide a clear, concise, and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for all its functions, including generating and applying configurations.
*   **NFR4:** **Maintainability:** The tool's architecture SHALL be modular, allowing for the independent development and addition of new authentication flow templates without requiring significant changes to the core generation engine.
*   **NFR5:** **Compatibility:** The generated configurations SHALL be compatible with Keycloak versions 20.0.0 and later.
*   **NFR6:** **Reliability:** The tool SHALL gracefully handle errors returned by the Keycloak Admin API, providing informative messages to the user that aid in troubleshooting.

## User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The tool's user experience (UX) vision is to provide a seamless, efficient, and intuitive command-line interface that abstracts away the complexity of Keycloak authentication flow configuration. Users should feel empowered to automate complex setups with simple, clear commands.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Command-Line Driven:** Primary interaction will be through well-defined commands and arguments.
*   **Clear Feedback:** Commands should provide immediate, clear, and concise feedback on success, failure, or progress.
*   **Non-Interactive by Default:** The core generation and application processes should be designed for automation and scripting, minimizing interactive prompts.

**Core Screens and Views (Core Interactions)**
*   **`generate` command:** To output the Keycloak authentication flow JSON configuration.
*   **`apply` command:** To push the generated configuration directly to a Keycloak realm.
*   **`verify` command:** To check the status of applied configurations in a Keycloak realm.

**Accessibility:** Standard CLI accessibility practices, ensuring clear text output, logical command flow, and avoiding reliance on color for critical information.

**Branding:** Consistent command naming conventions, argument structures, and output formatting to provide a cohesive user experience.

**Target Device and Platforms:** Cross-Platform CLI (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Technical Assumptions

**Repository Structure:**
*   **Polyrepo:** The tool will reside in its own repository, separate from other project components, allowing for independent versioning and deployment.

**Service Architecture:**
*   The tool will be a standalone CLI application, not requiring a separate backend service to operate. It will interact directly with the Keycloak Admin API.

**Testing Requirements:**
*   **Full Testing Pyramid:** The project will implement a comprehensive testing strategy including:
    *   **Unit Tests:** For individual functions and modules.
    *   **Integration Tests:** To verify interactions with the Keycloak Admin API.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** To validate the complete flow of generating and applying configurations to a live (test) Keycloak instance.

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests:**
*   **Keycloak Admin API Reliance:** All configuration changes will be performed exclusively through the official Keycloak Admin REST API.
*   **Secure Credential Management:** Sensitive credentials (Keycloak admin, identity provider secrets) will be managed via environment variables or a secure secrets management solution, and never hardcoded or committed to version control.
*   **Node.js Ecosystem:** Development will continue within the Node.js ecosystem, leveraging existing tools and libraries where appropriate.
