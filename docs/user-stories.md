### Story for Task 1: Extend CLI Framework for Authentication Flow Management

**Story Title:** Foundational CLI Structure for Flow Management - Brownfield Addition

**User Story:**
As a developer,
I want a new top-level `flow` command with `generate`, `apply`, and `verify` subcommands,
So that I have the foundational entry points for automating Keycloak authentication flow configuration.

**Story Context:**
*   **Existing System Integration:** Integrates with the main `yargs` instance in `src/index.js`.
*   **Technology:** Node.js, yargs.
*   **Follows pattern:** Follows the existing pattern for adding new commands to the CLI.
*   **Touch points:** `src/index.js`, and new module(s) under `src/commands/flow/`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new top-level command `flow` is available in the CLI.
2.  The `flow` command has three subcommands: `generate`, `apply`, and `verify`.
3.  Running the CLI with `flow --help` displays help text for the new subcommands.
4.  The new subcommands are registered but do not need to contain their full logic yet (stubs are acceptable).
5.  Existing CLI commands continue to work unchanged.

**Technical Notes:**
*   **Integration Approach:** A new command module will be created at `src/commands/flow/index.js` and registered with the main `yargs` instance in `src/index.js` as outlined in the architecture document.
*   **Key Constraints:** Must follow the existing command structure and argument parsing conventions.

I want to verify that the "first broker login" flow is correctly deployed in a realm using a `verify` command,
So that I can confirm the success of my automated deployment.

**Story Context:**
*   **Existing System Integration:** Implements the `VerifyFlowCommand` and uses the `KeycloakClient`.
*   **Technology:** Node.js.
*   **Follows pattern:** Uses the existing `KeycloakClient` for read-only API operations.
*   **Touch points:** `src/commands/flow/verify.js`, `src/services/keycloak-client.js`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `verify flow` command checks for the existence of the "first broker login" flow in the target realm.
2.  The command checks for the presence of the expected execution steps (Profile Completeness, Account Linking, Domain Validation).
3.  The command outputs a clear success or failure message based on its findings.

**Technical Notes:**
*   **Integration Approach:** The `VerifyFlowCommand` will use the `KeycloakClient` to make `GET` requests to the Keycloak Admin API to fetch the flow configuration for inspection.
*   **Key Constraints:** The verification logic should be robust enough to handle variations in the order of executions.
