# Aligned User Stories for Keycloak Configuration Server

This document contains the transformed user stories, aligned with the Express.js web server architecture.

---

### Story 1: Implement Foundational Express Server Structure
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want to** create the basic file and folder structure for the Express.js server, including a health check endpoint,
*   **so that** I have a functional starting point for building the API.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 1 (Extend CLI Framework)

---

### Story 2: Implement API Endpoint to Apply Authentication Flow
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want to** create a `POST /api/v1/realms/{realmName}/flows` endpoint,
*   **so that** I can programmatically apply a "first broker login" authentication flow to a Keycloak realm.
*   **Corresponds to original Tasks:** 2 (Generate JSON) & 3 (Apply Flow)

---

### Story 3: Enhance Flow Service with Profile Completeness
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want the** `FlowService` to include the "Update Profile" required action in the generated flow,
*   **so that** all users are forced to complete their profiles.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 4 (Add Profile Completeness)

---

### Story 4: Enhance Flow Service with Automatic Account Linking
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want the** `FlowService` to include the "Detect Existing Broker User" execution in the generated flow,
*   **so that** user accounts are automatically linked based on email.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 5 (Add Account Linking)

---

### Story 5: Enhance Flow Service with Domain Validation
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want the** `FlowService` to include a configurable script authenticator for email domain validation,
*   **so that** access can be restricted to approved domains.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 6 (Define Domain Validator)

---

### Story 6: Configure Domain List via API Request
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want the** `POST /flows` endpoint to accept a list of approved domains in the request body,
*   **so that** the domain validator can be configured dynamically for each request.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 7 (Integrate Domain List Config)

---

### Story 7: Implement API Endpoint to Verify Authentication Flow
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want to** create a `GET /api/v1/realms/{realmName}/flows/{flowAlias}/verify` endpoint,
*   **so that** I can programmatically verify that a flow has been deployed correctly.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 8 (Implement `verify` command)

---

### Story 8: Create E2E Test Suite for the API
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** an end-to-end test suite that calls the API endpoints and verifies the changes in a real Keycloak instance,
*   **so that** I can be confident in the service's reliability.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 9 (Create E2E Test Suite)

---

### Story 9: Implement JWT Authentication Middleware
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want to** secure the API endpoints with JWT authentication,
*   **so that** only authorized clients can use the service.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 10 (Security Review) - *re-scoped for API*

---

### Story 10: Finalize API Documentation
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want to** create an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for the new API,
*   **so that** clients have clear documentation on how to use the service.
*   **Corresponds to original Task:** 10 (Documentation) - *re-scoped for API*
